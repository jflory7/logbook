= Evaluating Open Source Hardware projects

== Certification

* https://www.oshwa.org/[Open Source Hardware Association]
* https://certification.oshwa.org/process.html[Certification Process]:
** Reference to best practices to ensure that your projects comply with the definition of Open Source Hardware
** Possible to write certification into a contract
* What does this mean?
** Everything is openly licensed
** Documented in a way where hardware people can take apart and understand the hardware itself
* What does this not do?
** That hardware actually works
* Turn-around time for certification:
** Initial review: 2 weeks
** Minority of things: Additional questions for clarification could add time
* *Recommendation*: Wait until you have a stable version to certify
** Obligation to update certification when significant changes made
** Easier to wait for a stable version so you don't have to keep re-certifying
** Also free

== Questions to ask

* Where are repositories with schematic designs?
** Get overview of what hardware is, design of hardware
** Drill down to specifics after high-level overview, e.g. accelerometor, BCBs
* What needs to be accessible?
** Build materials
** Schematics
** Part lists with licenses

== Open Know-How

* Data structure being designed to present information
* If OSHWA certification verifies if hardware is open, Open Know-How standardizes metadata about hardware
** More machine-readable
** "Here is a metadata standard, how you identify build materials, identify uses, etc."

== For UNICEF IF

* Begin certification process about ~10 months in
* Asking for things up-front in calls, e.g. build material list, schematics
** Reasonable amount of success leading up to actual certification
* Videos as a deliverable for documentation
