= Evaluating Open Source Hardware projects

== Questions to ask

* Where are repositories with schematic designs?
** Get overview of what hardware is, design of hardware
** Drill down to specifics after high-level overview, e.g. accelerometor, BCBs
* What needs to be accessible?
** Build materials
** Schematics
** Part lists with licenses
* Best practices to verify reproducibility?
* What to look for in early stages of open hardware development?
** What are milestones?
* Role of certification?
* Examples of Open Know-How format?


== Goals

* Open hardware projects empower the user without creating dependencies
* Decentralized way of producing things: Built on desire to share, make changes, adapt
* Reproduce the function, not an artifact


== Key components

=== Certification

* https://www.oshwa.org/[Open Source Hardware Association]
* https://certification.oshwa.org/process.html[Certification Process]:
** Reference to best practices to ensure that your projects comply with the definition of Open Source Hardware
** Possible to write certification into a contract
* What does this mean?
** Everything is openly licensed
** Documented in a way where hardware people can take apart and understand the hardware itself
* What does this not do?
** That hardware actually works
* Turn-around time for certification:
** Initial review: 2 weeks
** Minority of things: Additional questions for clarification could add time
* *Recommendation*: Wait until you have a stable version to certify
** Obligation to update certification when significant changes made
** Easier to wait for a stable version so you don't have to keep re-certifying
** Also free

=== Licensing

* What do licenses cover?
** Use, copying, modification, and distribution of hardware design documentation and the manufacture and distribution of products
* https://ohwr.org/cernohl[CERN-OHL] strives to be the GPL of hardware world
** Principles:
*** Anyone should be able to see the source (the design documentation in case of hardware)
*** Study it
*** Modify it
*** Share it

=== Reproducibility

* What _is_ reproducibility anyways?!
** Want to copy hardware and it be exactly the same? Not exactly…
** Regional focus might be more sustainable than universal reproducibility
*** Closing gaps for context across different areas
*** Teaching people _how_ to do the thing
** Can this project be reproduced regionally with what is being made locally?
* Buying parts (can they all be purchased from a bill of materials?)
** Thinking about M.V.P. for what parts are selected
** Choosing something easily available or more custom (3D-printed)
** Consider production chain for quality control / reproducibility

=== Documentation

* *Three components*: what is open and what is reproducible
.. Bill of materials (changes by location)
.. International-specific context!
.. Documenting assumptions
*** _Understand how you are taking decision you are taking and why_: So next person does not make same mistakes
*** _Documenting in accessible way_: So others can understand in more ways than text (videos, pictures, etc.)

==== Open Know-How

* *Open Know-How*: Data structure being designed to present information
** If OSHWA certification verifies if hardware is open, Open Know-How standardizes metadata about hardware
** More machine-readable
*** "Here is a metadata standard, how you identify build materials, identify uses, etc."
* Open documentation builds understanding of skills needed to make good decisions with hardware
** Good documentation explaining decision rationale is key for allowing others to make informed decisions about variations to hardware context
** About tracking changes


== For UNICEF IF

* Begin certification process about 10 months in
* Asking for things up-front in calls, e.g. build material list, schematics
** Reasonable amount of success leading up to actual certification
* Videos as a deliverable for documentation
* Q: How to convince folx that this is a positive thing for their project?
  And not giving away the secret sauce of how the product is made?
** Low commercial interest for open hardware…
** Companies in the open HW/SW world are worth millions and still making profit, paying salaries, etc.
** Open does not kill competitiveness
** How much time, effort, resources goes into filing a patent, litigating if needed, development is wasted on other custom resources
** Delays innovation; makes progress slower
** Better in terms of building a community but also move/grow faster and more disruptive
* Lack of business models?
** Focusing on use cases and domain
** Science: Power, effectiveness, and impact of open source is greater than closed, proprietary solution

=== Qualitative interviews

==== 2020-02-11: Open Hardware Leaders

* Focuses:
** Teaching project management skills
** Make assumptions explicit and design tests for those assumptions
*** Not just technical; assumptions about users and audience for public and community
*** Weekly reflections on tests for assumptions
* Licensing
* Community sustainability
** Participation guidelines
** Finding a team
** Building documentation in open and accessible way
* 14 week training program, obviously not enough time for development of full project
** 1st week: Scope participation in program
** 2nd week: Personas for users and contributors
* Turning early adopters into contributors
** How they can contribute?
** Lower access barriers
** Directly involve them in development
* How to grow community?
** Present different models of governance for working in open
** Onion model (core, outer layers)
