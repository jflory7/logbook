==========

These daily notes are intended to be a running log of what I've done during my
day. This helps me track my time to remind myself that I _am_ actually working
(thus defeating some imposter syndrome), and also helping me recap during our
daily scrum.

_Note_: I probably won't repeat this intro in future docs. It will probably
just be raw notes.

* [Looked into CodeClimate](https://codeclimate.com/github/jflory7/aggregate_airport_mobility) for `aggregate_airport_mobility`
    * Goal is to encourage and promote good habits for maintaining code – what if a core contributor leaves the project? Remember bus factor…
* [Configuring TravisCI](https://github.com/jflory7/magicbox-open-api/commit/782247dd05ed7aa8f64c0b5947d9cef9a8bd0ca8) on magicbox-open-api

    * [unicef/magicbox-open-api#30](https://github.com/unicef/magicbox-open-api/issues/30): Discovered regression bug that broke setup instructions and CI; I'm investigating now
        * This is why we want CI! Heheh.
* Minor things
    * [unicef/aggregate_airport_mobility#17](https://github.com/unicef/aggregate_airport_mobility/pull/17): Use correct config name in README for setup instructions

    * [unicef/aggregate_airport_mobility#21](https://github.com/unicef/aggregate_airport_mobility/issues/21): Filed issue to get description field filled in repo
        * Maybe update string at top of README by what's in the description field now?

**Tomorrow**: Jumping straight into [unicef/magicbox-open-api#30](https://github.com/unicef/magicbox-open-api/issues/30)
