==========

* Prepped GitHub Projects overview / live demo, presented to team
	* Closed: [unicef/magicbox#5](https://github.com/unicef/magicbox/issues/5)
* Science + Tech meeting with Office of Innovation
* Going deeper into [coordinates_to_admin_id_server](https://github.com/unicef/coordinates_to_admin_id_server)
    * Spent time figuring it out on my own, but was difficult
    * Had high-level and low-level explanation from Mike, which helped (took notes)
* Researching more about JavaScript ES6â€¦ didn't get that far. :(
