==========

Mixed day overall. Spent more time commuting, but still feel good about what I
was able to accomplish. Tomorrow is a work from home day until late afternoon,
so hoping to dive deeper on the things I started today.

* Unpacked call with Red Hat + UNICEF, sent feedback to Stephen Jacobs and team
* Set up GitHub organization-level project boards
    * [MagicBox - master board](https://github.com/orgs/unicef/projects/2?fullscreen=true)
    * [MagicBox - documentation](https://github.com/orgs/unicef/projects/3?fullscreen=true)
    * [MagicBox - community management](https://github.com/unicef/magicbox/projects/3?fullscreen=true)
* TravisCI [now building](https://travis-ci.org/unicef/coordinates_to_admin_id_server) on [coordinates_to_admin_id_server](https://github.com/unicef/coordinates_to_admin_id_server)
* [Setting up ReadTheDocs](https://readthedocs.org/projects/coordinates-to-admin-id-server/) for coordinates-to-admin-id-server
	* Took a while to get sphinx-js to work correctly in RTD â€“ needed to [specify the latest image](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/yaml-config.html#build-image) so `jsdoc` was available
	* Was setting up Travis, but couldn't get it to build... revisiting tomorrow
