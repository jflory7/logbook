==========

Mostly a catch-up day. First day back from travel.

* **Email / GitHub catch-up**: Sorting through inbox, GPG keysigning with UNICEF key, reviewing new activity in GitHub
* **Survey outreach**: Emailing individual people to take [survey](https://goo.gl/forms/gmKNdZR3EbHIlgq33) on MagicBox projects and community
* **Event reports**: Start writing event reports on key takeaways from conferences
* **Check-in with Mike**: Mike caught me up on what's happened in the last week, where we are, what my focus areas should be directed towards
