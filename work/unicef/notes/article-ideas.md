Working with open source in a non-profit is fascinating work, but also
challenging in many ways. I tried to find some advice or guidance on some
things, but I wasn't able to find what I was looking for. Maybe I could write
some of my own advice, once I get more experience in this trailblazing world.

* **Open source for non-profits: Participation vs. engagement**
    * I was looking for something with advice for getting a non-profit not just
      participating in open source, but also actively engaged with open source –
      there's a difference!
    * Advice for being successful in getting a non-profit engaged with open
      source
* **Open source for non-profits: How public is too public, how private is too
  private?**
    * Balancing the relationship between "public" and "private" info – open
      source thrives on transparency, but how do you find the happy balance for
      an international non-profit?
    * How to encourage a culture change for working in the open

I hope, for my future self, that I'll get to write these articles.
