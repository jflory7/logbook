* There is no library catalog of Internet podcasts, yet these are one of the most pervasive systems of sharing knowledge in 21st century media culture
* MusicBrainz is an effective catalog of music media - defined only by common metadata schemes, not actual content type
** i.e. MusicBrainz catalogs digital files in a common music codec format, but that definition could include more than only "music" files
* Podcasts remain a media accessible to most modern app / web music player clients
** What standards already exist for podcast metadata?
** Data exists already in ListenBrainz â€“ and will for anyone else submitting listens of podcasts in a client such as Google Play Music or Soundcloud
* _Vision_: Enable the proliferation of free/open metadata for podcasts so they are documented, organizable, and searchable for potential downstream uses of these data
