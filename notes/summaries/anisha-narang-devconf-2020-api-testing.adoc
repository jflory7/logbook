== Agenda

[arabic]
. Overview of REST API
. Introduction to API testing
. Overview of different API testing frameworks
. Introduction to LCC framework (lemoncheesecake)
. Understanding the matchers/assertions available
. Generating awesome reports


== Overview of REST API

* REST == ``REpresentational State Transfer''
** Literally: transferring a state of a common object from one place to another
* How it is done:
** JSON or XML format
** _API endpoint_:
   Where to go looking for the API
** HTTP methods:
*** `GET`: Retrieve info (read-only)
*** `POST`: Push data that triggers a state change or effect on server
**** _Example_: Submitting a form
*** `PUT`: Push data to update a representation of something on a server
**** _Example_: Editing a form
*** `DELETE`: Get rid of a resource
* _Example_: Travel site ticket portal interacting with different airline APIâ€™s to get prices and return them together in one interface


== Introduction to API testing

* API Testing: Software testing type that validates the API of any application
** tl;dr:
   Send calls to API and check they are right
* Need two tools:
** Drive/run API
** Write test code to test API


== Overview of different API testing frameworks

* `curl`:
  Simple tool to interact with HTTP requests/responses
* *Postman*:
  Google Chrome app with friendly GUI for interacting with HTTP APIs
* *JMeter*:
  Often used, although actually created for load testing
* *Karate*:
  Tool that works out of the box without prior programming knowledge required
* *Pytest*:
  Popular Python testing framework
* This talk focuses on *lemoncheesecake*


== Introduction to LCC framework (lemoncheesecake)

* *lemoncheesecake*:
  Functional test framework for Python
** Makes reporting a first-class citizen
** Provides fixtures, matchers, etc.
** Add metadata to your tests, create automatic reports
* How to get started:
  `pip install lemoncheesecake`
* Writing test suite:
** `lcc bootstrap test-project`
** Creates:
   `fixtures/`, `suites/`, `project.py`
* Run test suite:
  `lcc run`
** Advanced information:
   `lcc report`


== Understanding the matchers/assertions available

* Matchers:
** Examples:
   `equal_to()`, `is_true()`, `is_dict()`, `is_()`, `is_not()`, etc.
* Matching operations:
** `check_that(hint, actual, matcher, quiet=False)`:
   Run matcher, log result, return matching result as boolean
** `require_that(hint, actual, matcher, quiet=False)`:
   Run matcher, log result, raise `AbortTest` if match fails
** `assert_that(hint, actual, matcher, quiet=False)`:
   Run matcher; if match fails and only if it fails, log result and raise `AbortTest`

[source,python]
----
data = {"title": "Title 1", "uuid: "aaa11"}
check_that("title_is", data, has_entry("title", equal_to("Title 1")))
check_that("uuid_is", data, has_entry("uuid", equal_to("aaa11")))
----

* Logging
** Uses built-in logging functions
** `+log_debug(msg)+`, `+log_info(msg)+`, `+log_warn(msg)+`,
`+log_error(msg)+`
