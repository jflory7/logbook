== 7 deadly sins of public speaking

* *Gossip* (speaking ill of others)
* *Judging* (creating a feeling that audience is being judged)
* *Negativity*
* *Complaining* (a.k.a. viral misery)
* *Excuses*
* *Lying* (including exaggerations)
* *Dogmatism* (mixing facts and opinions but presenting as fact)

== Four foundations for effective public speaking

* Acronym: *H.A.I.L.*
** H: *Honesty* (be clear and straight)
** A: *Authenticity* (be yourself)
** I: *Integrity* (be your word)
** L: *Love* (wish them well)
* Need a balance of all four, not too much of any single quality

== Speaking tools

* *Register*: Locate your voice across different ranges
** Example: Speaking with weight by using the voice from your chest (compared to a nasally voice in nose)
* *Timbre*: Texture of voice (practice with things like good posture while presenting)
* *Prosody*: "Sing-song" qualities of voice (not speaking monotonic or flat)
* *Pace*: Use speed to slow down and emphasize
** Silence is also a powerful tool; avoid um's and ah's
* *Pitch*: Meaning changes in delivery
* *Volume*:
** Loud volume / broadcasting to emphasize (but be careful, don't overdo it)
** Soft volume / quietness to cue paying close attention
