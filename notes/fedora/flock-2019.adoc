= Flock 2019 written notes

Transcribed conference notes I took from different sessions at https://flocktofedora.org/[Fedora Flock] 2019 in Budapest, Hungary.


[[rh-ibm-fedora]]
== Red Hat + IBM + Fedora (Denise Dumas)

* Affiliated entity (Red Hat underneath IBM
* Acquisitions team @ IBM not involved with Red Hat deal
** Discarded process for Red Hat buyout
* Fedora's historical relationship with change (versus obsolescence)
** Easier for IBM to get changes in by working within community to embrace relationship with change
* IBM adopting same policy as Red Hat for contributing to open source on contributor's free time (Chris Ferris, IBM CTO for Open Tech)


[[rhel-8]]
== Where RHEL 8 diverged from Fedora and why (panel)

* Faster RHEL is coming (three-year release cycles)
* Package selection
** RHEL mostly subset of Fedora, some different dependencies
* Compatibility
** DNF -> yum-4
*** _Wrapper not enough_:
    Changed flags from in-house legacy scripts by customers.
*** More consistency among reliable automation
** Revert default syslog
** Introduction of platform-python
*** Switchable system Python; customer choice
* CI/gating (context of shorter release cycles)
** "Test early, test often"
** Gating like an airport gate:
   review, recheck, regroup
** Fast feedback for those who act on it and while you can act on it
* Upstream First:
  Bring test code upstream too
** Red Hat developers bringing package tests into Fedora
* Opportunities and objectives
** More transparency:
   Make development visible
*** Thinking of where volunteers spend their time
*** 2 years to get things in Fedora for RHEL 9
*** Rings 20:
    OS/application division
**** More pulling from Fedora and pushing more things through Fedora
**** Updating policy to find the middle ground


[[mindshare]]
== Mindshare Year in Review (Jared Smith)

* Some initiatives like release parties going well
* Need more metrics!
* Marketing team focus
** Biggest bottleneck: ??


[[agile]]
== Open Source Agile (Red Hat Community Platform Engineering Team)

* Agile is hard mindset shift; mindshare is hard
** Might not be prepared with workflows
* Planes that "don't come back" from agile
** Need to embrace failures
** Sticking through it for long-term
* Value statements align with agile values
** Compatible with open source / Fedora
* Collaborative teamwork is foundational
** Identifying stakeholders:
   communicate and involve them
** Stakeholders express needs
* Requirements Gate for CPE
** Two-way street of participation for stakeholders and team
* Values-driven planning:
  Everyone wants something (Red Hat, CentOS, Fedora, CPE)
** Have to maximize values for time
** Priorities decided by consensus (stakeholders, team members)
** Communication back is key from both sides
* All about transparency - the community knows
* Talk with other stakeholders (scratch our backs, scratch yours)
* Understanding our remit
* Defining mission:
  lighthouse in the dark (confusion)
** Must fit within mission; offers ability to protect self
* Step back strategy:
.. Own it all
.. Host it
.. Community owns it
.. Looking to retire
* Feedback as critical mechanism
* Getting ready and done
** Requirements, stakeholder, team prepped/ready
** Stakeholder:
   Sign-off criteria for completion

* Fedora Badges?
** Council approach? Maybe not
** Collecting design team feedback into concrete priorities?


[[communishift]]
== Communishift (Kevin Fenzi)

* History:
  Fedora Infra Private Cloud
* Communishift:
  OpenShift 4.1
** More self-service than previous offerings, less maintenance
* Use cases:
** Proof of concepts
** Apps to get Fedora work done more efficiently
** Apps supported by community
** Way to learn about using OpenShift
* What Infra does:
** Platform, that's it
** Outages / downtime as needed
** Intended to be as self-service as possible
* What YOU support:
** Backups (`oc export`? `git` repo? need hosting)
** Git / S.C.M. for changes
** Display how people can get a hold of you
* Get access
** Ping nirik
** Later:
   FAS group
** Later:
   More widespread usage later on
* Quotes:
  5 projects, 10 pods, 5 pvcs
** Flexible
* "Future"
** kubevirt / CNV:
   Manage containers as VMs (`ssh` access)
** Wider availability pending bugs
** Existing cloud apps migrated this way
* Heartbeats
** Knowing an application is being used
** How to measure project activity (OS alert manager)
* Apps must be Fedora-related
* https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Infrastructure/Communishift
* CPE hackfest @ 9am Sunday:
  opportunity to get hands-on?
