Article summary from https://opensource.com/[Opensource.com].

== Overview

* 12 basic principles of agile
* Focus on solving chunks of problems at a time (vs. planning start-to-finish)
** Sometimes things change!

== Principles

=== Customer-first

* Satisfy customer/stakeholder through early and continuous delivery
* Solve problems for customer, not build features/tools because they are cool
* Reduces time from project initiation to customer feedback
** Corollary: Faster CI/CD environment, faster to share something with customer (e.g. staging instance)

=== Only constant is change

* Normally it is radical to change requirements later: not with agile
* If end-goal is to serve customer, must be flexible to respond to customers' behaviors/needs
* Flexibility first, following a carefully constructed plan second

=== Deliver faster

* Deploy changes faster (vs. calendar-based patches)
* Smaller, more frequent releases allow for regular updates with minimal risk
* Waiting for big releases creates unforeseen issues no matter how much it is tested

=== Build cross-functional teams

* Different teams work together throughout process: not in linear progression
* Gets everyone to have some skin in the game
* Harder to push errors or low-quality tech on others
* Needs top-level engagement

=== Encourage independent work

* More flexibility to learn new skills while working on projects
* Teams are typically self-directed: need a focused goal
* "Build projects around individuals.
  Give them the environment and support they need and trust them to get the job done."

=== Meet in person

* In-person meetings encouraged for conveying critical information
* Non-remote: Closer interaction in physical areas
* Remote: Simulate virtual meetings, use tools like Slack/Zoom, etc.

=== Go live

* Deploy working version of software as soon as possible
* Critical frame of reference for evaluating priorities

=== Sustainable development

* Vital to make sustainable and scalable code
* Think ahead of time about big picture
* Remember to maintain work-life balance to avoid burnout

=== Technical excellence

* Every team member is responsible for success
* Anyone involved can be a basic QA tester
* Everyone is responsible for providing clear code/instructions through the process - not just at the end

=== Simplify

* "Maximize the amount of work not done"
* Eliminate and automate as much as possible

=== Let teams self-organize

* Leave room for independence; don't be a helicopter manager
* Let teams figure out what needs to be done and how to get it done

=== Take time to reflect

* Reflections at regular intervals
* Introspect and evaluate efficiency from time to time
* Helps you discover better ways of working and how to evolve
