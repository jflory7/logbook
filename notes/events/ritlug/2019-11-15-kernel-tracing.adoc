== ftrace

== eBPF

* Grew out of BPF: Berkeley packet filters
** Filtering language useful for running user code inside kernel
* eBPF: "Virtual machine" inside the kernel

== eBPF Compiler collection (BCC)

* https://github.com/iovisor/bcc[github.com/iovisor/bcc]
* Set of tools to make writing and interacting with eBPF easier
** Write kernel instrumentation in C
** Write front-ends in Python
* Why?
** You can do kernel eBPF kernel things in C, as expected
** Then send data to userspace Python scripts
** Much easier to work with data in Python
*** Be considerate of how often things get sent to userspace (it is expensive)
* BCC has some nice things to make life easier:
** Functions: Writing to shared tracing pipe (same one used by `ftrace`)
* Macros and functions for things like:
** Maintaining hashes that can later be accessed by userspace
** Building historgrams, also accessible in userspace later
* Includes existing, pre-written tools
** https://github.com/iovisor/bcc[Great examples] of how to write programs

== BPF Trace

* https://github.com/iovisor/bpftrace
* Useful to mention, but a small tool (not useful for writing scripts/programs at scale)
** ???

== Where to start?

* A suggested approach:
.. Pick some arbitrary thing, like doing a DNS lookup with `nslookup`
.. Observe it using `ftrace`
.. See what kernel functions are called
.. Pick more obvious ones (e.g. network, I/O, filesystem, etc.)
..  See if you can write a BCC program to collect data (how many times the function is called, its arguments, etc.)
* Suggested approach: Read the example code first, then work your way down

== Live demo

* For understanding `strace` calls, do not forget about `man` pages for understanding the syscalls!

== Tips and tricks for learning

* All these tools have lots of examples
** eBPF ecosystem, in particulae, has tons of pre-written tools and examples
* BCC developer tutorial to be helpful (check BCC docs folder)
* While eBPF tools provide lots of featuresâ€¦ batteries not included

== Q&A

=== What does filtering for SELinux contexts look like?

No idea!
Trace by SELinux function calls makes sense in a trace.

[source,bash]
----
grep -i selinux available_filter_functions
----

=== From a devops/monitoring perspective, where might these tools be useful?

=== Have you used `bpftrace`? Any suggestions on getting started?

Trace things you're interested in.
Use some of the https://github.com/iovisor/bpftrace/blob/master/tools/execsnoop_example.txt[sample tools] upstream provides.
