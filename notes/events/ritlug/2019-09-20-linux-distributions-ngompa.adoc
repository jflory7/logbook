= Linux Distributions, presented by Neal Gompa (Datto Inc.)

== RPM distributions

* SUSE/openSUSE
** Full, top-to-bottom integration testing approach
** Use AppArmor vs. SELinux
*** Novell bought company developing AppArmor; inherited it in the purchase
*** AppArmor: Fired SUSE/Novell employees, many moved to Canonical and continued development there
* Mageia
** Development branch: Cauldron
** Large, RPM distribution built mostly by a community (i.e. no major organization backers)
** Flagship: KDE
** Once-a-year releases
** Awesome, friendly community!

== dpkg distributions

* Debian
** Packaging system its own, dpkg
** Development branch: Debian Sid
** Also not backed by a single commercial entity
** Emphaizes stability, i.e. older software
** Major releases appx. 3 years
** Security measures (SELinux) optional by default
* Ubuntu
** Packaging system: dpkg, increasingly snap
** No development branch, but there are LTS releases
** Canonical is driving force behind Ubuntu
** Focuses heavily on desktop/server applications
*** Heavy migrations to snaps
** Security measures are off by default and weak by default
** *Ubuntu Core*: Variant intended for appliances that only uses snaps

== Other distributions

* Arch
** Packaging system its own, PKGBUILD
** *`pacman`* manages packages
** No development branch: full rolling release
** Very useful documentation in Arch Wiki, even for non-Arch users
** No instaler system: Requires manual effort to install and set up
** Offers "ports"-like system to enable installing software from source reproducibly
* Gentoo
** Packaging system: ebuild / emerge builds
** *Portage* manages packages
** Entire distribution built from source code
** Also offers "ports"
** Offers capability to easily customize software to build time

== Q&A

* Q: *Do you think Ubuntu Core is the future of Ubuntu?*
** A: Yes;
   Snaps have a great development experience.
   Canonical is pushing more for developers to package applications instead of distributions packaging software (thus, eliminating middle-man maintainership).
   _Aside_: Poor attraction of corporate contributors to distributions even like Fedora.
   How can we improve the developer relationship of people outside of distributions are included?
   _Aside_: Fedora should state its intent more clearly as a distribution with one purpose to be upstream for RHEL

== Notes

* Look around and see what other people are doing
* Do other people have similar problems?
  What have other people tried?
* Pure community distributions do not succeed because of capitalist society demands
* Ubuntu/Windows standardized on good user / developer experiences influencing what technology people choose in the workplace
