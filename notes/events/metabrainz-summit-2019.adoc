= MeB Summit 2019 notes

This is a rough document with some notes I took during the https://wiki.musicbrainz.org/MusicBrainz_Summit/19[2019 MetaBrainz Summit] in Barcelona, 27 September to 29 September.
Minutes and logs can be found in https://docs.google.com/document/d/1abk9f755ewoCBvuoxJPRgpFB0qXeICbNuzcqx6DBhcQ/edit?usp=sharing[this Google Doc].

== 2019-09-28: Community engagement / outreach

We split discussion into internal and external audiences.
Then I realized I should have slept more last night or worked out a better way of facilitating this discussion.
Sort of felt like I barged in with solutions before fully analyzing the ideas and perhaps the solutions I suggested are biased to me.
Hopefully it was still useful for the 15 minutes I had to prepare to lead.

The [I] represents internal focus and [E] represents external focus.

* [I/E] Cash salaries, or working closer with community?
** MeB is high bus factor, high elephant factor
* [E] AB: Are there ways for people to interact/engage with AB project community without stressing engineering resources (i.e. time)?
** Drive-by contributions
* [E] Is the data scientist approach to attracting LB contributors the right audience? What about everyday listeners to diversify the data set?
** [I/E] Diversity and inclusion perspectiveâ€¦
* [I, some E] How to address bus factor?
* [I] What does closer integration between pieces look like? Is there a roadmap?
