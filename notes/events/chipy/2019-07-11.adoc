== Lowering the Stakes of Failure with Pre-mortems and Post-mortems

Elizabeth Sander

=== Abstract

Failure can be scary.
There are real costs to a company and its users when software crashes, models are inaccurate, or when systems go down.
The emotional stakes feel high-- no one wants to be responsible for a failure.
We can lower the stakes by creating spaces to learn from failures, and minimize their impact.
This talk introduces two ways to address failure: blameless post-mortems, to learn from an incident; and pre-mortems, to identify modes of failure upfront.

=== Notes

==== Intro

* Failure takes many forms; what it looks like depends on you
* Failure is scary because nobody wants to feel responsible for causing problems
** Mistakes happen within a context
*** Team: Time pressures, incentives, norms, training, expertise, etc.)
*** Process: Testing, docs, time/issue tracking, code/method reviews
* Individuals make mistakes; we need to expect that and prepare correctly
** Blameless post-mortems one method to do this

==== Post-mortems

* Identify root cause, come up with action items to follow up on
* _Blameless_: Create a place where people can feel comfortable to bring up issues without finger-pointing
* Accountability but not responsibility on any one person
** If one person is directly responsible?
   Not true, most of the time.
** Manager addresses poor performance, not for a post-mortem
* Before post-mortem:
** Invite people directly involved (inc. a facilitator, like a manager)
** For major incidents: Affected stakeholders (e.g. clients)
** Prep with basic details:
*** Incident period, status, summary, impact (from perspective of users), trigger, detection, resolution, action items
* During post-mortem:
** Let facilitator drive
** Review a timeline of what happened / when (where did things start going wrong?)
** Agree on trigger, impact, root causes
*** Trigger: Immediate cause
*** Impact: What was affected
** What went well?
*** What parts of process should be kept/replicated?
** What went badly?
*** Identify attention areas
** Where did we get lucky?
*** Where things could have gone bad but didn't - helpful to evaluate during the post-mortem
** Agree on action items and owners
*** Example: Updates to a release checklist
** Lessons learned: Summary of key takeaways
* What next?
** Follow up on action items
** Share post-mortem document more widely with company or even externally
*** Keep post-mortems together for future reference (organization)

==== Pre-mortem

* Evaluate areas of failure before they happen
* Pre-requirements:
** Facilitator (ideally neutral party)
** Stakeholders across departments / teams / groups
* Structure:
** *Brainstorm*: Our project has failed - what happened?
** *Organize*: Identify common groupings, patterns across potential areas of failure
** *Estimate importance and discuss*: Assign risk categories, rank by probability and impact, multiply results
*** "What could we have done to avoid or mitigate the failure?"
** *After the meeting*:
*** Send out notes
*** Check in on risks during project lifecycle
*** Integrate into project management methodlogy (e.g. agile)
* Why bother?
** People are nervous to bring up a topic because of emotional responsibility
** But bringing up these things is good and creating a culture around this allows everyone to make their concerns known
** Helps engineers keep these issues in mind while developing
** Also helpful to bring in technical and non-technical folks!
** Helps get everyone on board with the project (i.e. motivation)

==== Summary

* We can only learn from failure by bringing it into the open.
* But to do that, we need to lower the emotional stakes, both of failing and talking about failure.
* Pre-mortems and post-mortems are tools for this.
* Avoid the blame!

==== Q&A

* How long should a post-mortem take?
** Depends; but about 1 hour is good place to start (with prep work done in advance)
* Challenges during pre-mortem?
** How to allocate time (e.g. enough time in brainstorming to come up with ideas, but not letting it dominate the full time)
** Perhaps drive towards voting method
** Possibly split into two meetings
** Time management is hard
** Integrate pre-mortem notes into retrospective

== Web Scraping for Fun and Profit (Profit not Included)

Matt Inwood

=== Abstract

Not all data is easily accessible.
Taking info from a website that requires authentication, interaction, or even just to load a fancy script.
This talk will discuss using Selenium to level up your web scraping skills, with examples and suggested practices.

=== Notes

* Web Driver Automation
** Testing
** Data mining / web scraping
** AI interactions
** Lots more of ideas limited to your imagination
* What you need:
** Python
** Selenium
** Browser
** Web driver:
*** Firefox: geckodriver
*** Chrime: ChromeDriver
* Using https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/set[NYTimes puzzle sets] as an example
* Execution steps
** Open browser with webdriver
** Finding elements (`browser.find_elements_by_class_name()`)
** Navigating the DOM
** Getting info from elements
*** `elem.text`
*** `elem.get_attribute('attr_name')`
*** `elem.find_element/s`

=== Q&A

* Running headless is challenging
* BeautifulSoup vs. Selenium?
** Needing to interact with the page or executing JavaScript: BeautifulSoup hasn't really figured this out yet

== Limit the Guesswork in Fantasy Baseball by Using Python for Data Analysis

Nicholas Marey

=== Abstract

Daily fantasy sports has become a booming industry.
One leader in the space is Fanduel who after raising $275 million in their series E funding, brought their valuation to over $1 billion.
As the popularity of daily fantasy sports has taken off, critics have argued that success is the result of luck; yet the consistent success of a select group of players would suggest that success can be driven by skill.
This talk, will go over how one could use Python to level the playing field.

=== Notes

* Baseball is useful for statistical analysis due to its series of 1x1 interactions (finite number of states)
* Unfortunately I did not study enough statistics to grok most of this one and it is a lot of Jupyter / pictures
* No slides :(

== Miscellaneous

* Microsoft SQL Server 2017+ supports machine learning
** Basically embed Python into SQL tables - cool!
