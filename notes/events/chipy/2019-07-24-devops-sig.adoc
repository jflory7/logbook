== Debugging with pdb

Kevin Nasto

=== Abstract

Did you know that Python comes built-in with a powerful debugging tool called PDB (Python DeBugger)?
This lightning talk will go over how to set breakpoints, inspect data structures, and step through your code in real-time!

=== Notes

* pdb is a debugging tool for Python code

==== Why pdb?

* Built into all versions of Python
* Use it anywhere, almost any library / framework
* Execute code line-by-line
* Execute any code with an interpreter

==== Alternatives

* `print()`, Jupyter Notebook, debugging in IDE

==== How to use it?

. Import
. Set breakpoint
. Run code

[source,python]
----
import pdb

pdb.set_trace()

# next steps: pdb commands
n  # next: execute next line of code
s  # step
c  # continue: execute code until next breakpoint
----

==== Live example

[source,python]
----
import pdb

def fib(num):
    if num <= 1:
        return num
    else:
        pdb.set_trace()
        return fib(num - 1) + fib(num - 2)

fib(3)

== Application Security for Python Programmers

James Jeffryes

=== Abstract

Python is a growing choice for business applications processing sensitive user data and performing mission-critical tasks.
That makes it vital for programmers to be aware of common security vulnerabilities that can undermine the Confidentiality, Integrity, and Accessibility of these Python applications.
Fortunately, many of these risks can be managed with patterns for safe handling of user input as well as tools for dependency monitoring and static code analysis.

=== Notes

==== Outline

. Broad overview of risk types
. Common vulnerabilities, how to avoid
. Tools/strategies to avoid vulns

==== Overview of risk types

* What is security? CIA Triad:
** Confidentiality: system conceals private data
** Integrity: system does only what it is designed to do
** Availability: system remains accessible under attack
* Imagine financial institutions (e.g. bank, Social Security Admin… Equifax)
* Create a table to "grid out" your surface areas (e.g. database, application code, server, etc.)
** Confidentiality: User info? Trade secrets? Private keys?
** Integrity: Network access?
** Accessibility: Cohosting?
* Find the business problems you need to solve

==== Common vulnerabilities, how to avoid

* Check out https://www.owasp.org[OWASP] for database of common vulns

===== Input injection

* Consider SQL query to figure out a product ID; append an unexpected statement (e.g. `DROP table`)
* Several ways for an attacker to inject arbitrary input, mostly limited to your imagination
* _Never execute raw SQL from a user_
* Instead: Use Object Relational Mapping library like SQLalchemy or parameterized SQL statements
* `subprocess.call`: Never use `shell=True`, use argument lists instead
* Always use `ast.literal_eval()` with user input strings

===== Deserializing data

* Possible to execute Python when an object loaded from YAML
** Update `pyyaml` or use `safe_load()`
* Python allows objects to define how to pickle themselves with `__reduce__`
** Don't unpickle anything you did not create

===== Memory saturation

* Zip files can be filled with large amounts of nested data
** _Stream zipped data into fixed-size buffer and bail out if you hit your limit_
* XML allows for internal, compact references but expand to huge sizes
** XML also allows referencing external links
** _Use `defusedxml`_

===== Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

* XSS hijacks site to serve malicious code to your users
* Use caution with `<script>` tag in bare HTML
** Use `html.escape()` or your framework's equivalent to clean user data from an API

===== Do not trust dependencies

* PyPI is great because you can install anything, it is terrible because you can install anything
** Ask yourself:
*** Is your interpreter up to date?
*** Do you know if your dependencies are vulnerable?

==== Tools and strategies to address security vulnerabilities

===== Use static checking: code

* *Bandit* is an open source tool to check for unsafe imports/calls in code
** Easy to add in CI pipeline
** Helps junior devs to be aware and keeps team honest

===== Use static checking: dependencies

* GitHub: automatic emails
* PyUp: Supports more options, free for FOSS
* Safety: Derivative work from PyUp

===== Check your feature additions

* The more features, the bigger the attack surface
* More features, harder to predict how they interact
* Harder to keep up to date

===== Secure design early

* Tempting to target shiny features first… but better to show incremental progress
* Think about access control up front
** Easier to add in as you go vs. adding later
* Better to never show a feature than be forced to take it away later for security reason
** Pretend: Data researchers who can run raw SQL and then you take it away because, duh!

===== Logging

* You need to know something is up ASAP for damage control
* Use logging in your code, use monitoring infrastructure
