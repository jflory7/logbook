== Workflow

* Typically work towards a major goal each semester
** This semester's goal: Porting from NodeJS to Golang

== Code structure

* Main runner in `teleirc.js` calls different configurations and local libraries (e.g. IRC/Telegram listeners)
** Creates, configures, runs IRC/Telegram bots
* Two split sides: *Telegram* and *IRC* handlers

** General handlers: actions, errors, joining channe, kicking, messaging, NickServ, leaving channel
* Some other helper functions for both sides of bridge
