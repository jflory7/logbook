This document explains my "Zen of i3wm/Sway".
It is a mindset I use to maximize productivity, help me divide my work into smaller pieces, and most importantly, stay focused.
At some point, I might turn this into more formal content like an Opensource.com article.
For now, it is for me!


== Workspaces

Ever heard of "burndown charts" and "working down a priority queue"?
I heard of them but admittedly do not fully comprehend them yet.
Nonetheless, this approach could align well with workflows that prioritize time-tracking.

=== Universal:

==== 1. Workspace #1 is "personal" only.

This is the "me" window.
Any articles I want to read, things I want to work on my personal time, music lyric analysisâ€¦ they all go here and stay here.
It is also a good "catch-all" window if you don't know what to categorize something right away.

==== 2. Workspace #2 is email only.

I use a mail client desktop application.
I assign it to start in Workspace #2 in my `.i3/config`.
This isolates email to its own workspace, because email is its own mentally-demanding task.

Keeping email in one place also makes it easy to turn off if you need to quiet notifications and focus.

==== 3. Workspace #3 is for the DJ's.

I normally listen to music while I use my operating system.
Whatever music or audio source I am listening from, it goes here.
This also makes it easy to memorize the keybind for changing to workspace as specific to music.

=== If two monitors:

==== 1.

=== If one monitor:

==== 1.
