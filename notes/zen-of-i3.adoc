This document explains my "Zen of i3wm/Sway".
It is an approach I use to maximize productivity, divide my work into smaller pieces, and most importantly, stay focused.
At some point, I might turn this into more formal content like an Opensource.com article.
For now, it is for me!


== Workspaces

Ever heard of "burndown charts" and "working down a priority queue"?
I heard of them but admittedly do not fully comprehend them yet.
Nonetheless, this approach could align well with workflows that prioritize time-tracking.

The workspace philosophy below explains how I use i3.

=== Workspace #1 is personal.

This is the "me" window.
Any articles I want to read, things I want to work on my personal time, music lyric analysisâ€¦ they all go here and stay here.
It is also a good "catch-all" window when I don't know what to categorize something as right away.

=== Workspace #2 is email.

I use a mail client desktop application.
I assign it to start in Workspace #2 in my `.i3/config`.
This isolates email to its own workspace, because email is its own mentally-demanding task.

Keeping email in one place also makes it easy to turn off if you need to quiet notifications and focus.

=== Workspace #3 is music.

I normally listen to music while I use my operating system.
Whatever music or audio source I am listening from, it goes here.
This also makes it easy to memorize the keybind for changing to workspace as specific to music.

=== Workspace #4 is chat.

My chat programs (IRC, Telegram, Matrix/Riot, video conference clients, etc.) go into this workspace.
It keeps it easy to segment what can quickly become a distraction into its own workspace.
It also makes it easy to isolate chat distractions, because of Workspace #4 isn't there, then I'm not going to get pinged and side-tracked when I need to focus.

=== Workspaces #5-9 are temporary.

These workspaces are temporary and based on specific context.
For example, Workspace #5 might be my academic work and Workspace #6 might be related to my dayjob.
Organizing similar windows together makes it easier for me to regain focus and change contexts more easily.
Just think about how much time we waste each day switching between different projects, tasks, or work.

However, avoid working in these workspaces.
These are like drawers of a filing cabinet.
You don't write a report from inside a filing cabinet.
You write it on your desk.

=== Workspace #10 is active.

Workspace #10 (or Super+0) is the active workspace.
Whatever needs to be done from Workspaces #4-9 is moved to this workspace.
This helps me focus and keep me grounded in what I need to accomplish.

If I need to take a break from an incomplete task, I move what is in Workspace #10 back to one of Workspaces #4-9.
When I start something new, it goes to Workspace #10.
