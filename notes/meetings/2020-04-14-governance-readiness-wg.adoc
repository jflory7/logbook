== Pre-meeting notes

* Interventions:
  Could include shift from one governance model to another based on changing needs.
* Methodology:
  When do we start asking which questions?
* Next steps:
** +1: Find the common language (or what a first draft of elements might be)
** +0: Before creating resources, have conversations in the open
** +0: Important to cater challenges to people first instead of problems

=== Questions to address

* *Goal*:
** What do you understand by “governance readiness”? (e.g., ability to be governed, things to change to enable a specific governance models, etc.)
*** Defined blueprint of defined values and common assumptions for future planning of how a project is managed over time
** What do you understand by “checklist”? does it refer to a methodology?
*** Strategic and tactical thinking are two ways to approach.
* *What to do next*:
** What should be the most immediate target? (e.g., ways to represent governance models, catalog of models, etc.)
*** Calibrate to everyone's reasons for showing up to generate traction
** Should we focus on specific topics? (e.g., community, methodology, etc.)
*** Could be on advice on growth management and how to adapt as your project changes in size or scope
** When should we have the next meeting? monthly basis?
*** +1 once monthly, could do twice a month if structure is there


== Meeting notes

* Why are we here?
** Governance as key part of sustainability
** All of us echoed a common sentiment of wanting to spend time making implicit questions about governance more explicitly.
* Classification:
  Different dimensions focused on during workshop
* Intervals / time periods:
** Day-to-day
** Barriers & Needs
** Interventions
* Mechanisms for change:
** Decision-making mechanisms
** Community
** Methodology
** Legal
* Q: What does success look like from this classification?
** How/where do we go from here?
** What is a satisfactory accomplishment for this group?
* Path forward:
** Define a first draft of common elements of *good* and *bad* governance, based on https://docs.google.com/document/d/14xpOea_P8FZlcuppzqzwLqXyr4pgyddpBXXwlaHOH8c/edit?usp=sharing[sticky feedback]
** Before we release a standard or common spec, have conversations in the open
*** Information interviews with projects about what we're working on
** Then, based on the standard/spec we draft, return to our unique networks with the shared, collaborative work
* Questions & decision-making tools:
** Example: A CoC is not a checkbox solution; needs to be designed within clear frameworks where a Code of Conduct is "plugged in"
