= Carl Fogel - Producing Open Source Software notes

== Chapter 1: Introduction

* What persuades people to stick around to produce something useful?
** "_People should feel that their connection to a project, and influence over it, is directly
proportional to their contributions._"

== Chapter 2: Getting started

* *Terminology clarification*:
** _User_: Uses project as part of personal / professional work
** _Developer_: Contributes bugfixes and enhancements back upstream to project
* Need to acquire:
** Users
** Developers
* Appearances matter
** Acknowledging importance of first impression
** Detecting investment of care
** Impression created carries over to rest of project by association
* *SCORING*: Obvious where a link goes before clicking on it
** Developer vs. user documentation
* Presence of certain stand offerings reassures users (to use project) and developers (to contribute)
** Send message: "_Your time will not be wasted if you get involved_"
* Common for developers to be users, but not always
** Especially for large projects created to meet enterprise-scale needs
** Developers may not be direct users but usually involved with an internal team that uses the software

=== Starting From What You Have

* Transform private vision to public one
** Organizing / documenting things everyone involved already knows
* Minimum activation energy to on-board contributors
* *SCORING*: Choose a good name
** A good name:
*** Gives an idea of what project does
*** Easy to remember (non-native speakers)
*** Not a duplicate / does not infringe trademark
*** Available as .com/.net/.org TLDs
*** Available on micro-blogging sites (e.g. Twitter)
* *SCORING*: Clearly state project is open source
* *SCORING*: Offer features / requirements list
** Something to give someone asking for quick summary of software
* *SCORING*: Development status
** Reflect reality
* *SCORING*: Downloads / ease of building
** Many projects don't standardize install procedures until late
** "We'll sort it out when the code is closer to being ready"
** This takes code longer to get ready
** Discourages developers who may otherwise have contributed, if they could build / test it
** Project will never know they are losing developers
*** Who will ever know except the person themselves?
** Boring work with high payoff should _always_ be done early
* *SCORING*: Unique version number ([https://semver.org/]semver.org)
* *SCORING*: Public and active bug tracker
** More bugs in database, the _better_ the project looks, because:
*** Absolute number of actual software defects present
*** Number of people using software
*** Convenience with which those people report new bugs
** Any software of sufficient size and complexity has arbitrary number of bugs to discover
*** How well does project record and prioritize them?
** Empty is scary
** New project has less, but key part is a _healthy rate_ of filings
** http://www.rants.org/2010/01/10/bugs-users-and-tech-debt/[Bugs are good news]
* *SCORING*: Communications channels present
** Way to reach the developers
** Like a chat room
* *SCORING*: Developer / contributing guidelines
