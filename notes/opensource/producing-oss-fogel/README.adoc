= Carl Fogel - Producing Open Source Software notes

https://producingoss.com/[Source material]


== Chapter 0: Preface

* "Competence at cooperation" as highly-valued skill
* Free software: Many models to compare, few to equate
** Business, non-profit / NGO, government, etc.
* FOSS project started, not run
** Working together == tangible benefits to software


== Chapter 1: Introduction

* Unrealistic expectations
** Open sourcing a troubled project does not cure ills
** Introduces new complexities; can cost more than in-house if approach is incorrect
* Early days of Mozilla and challenges (pg. 1)
** "Open source pixie dust"
* Categories of success / fail:
** Presentation / packaging
** Project management
** Cultural navigation (default behaviors in FOSS)
* Cross-pollination of ideas: Like going to a conference without actually traveling
* Effort to FOSS correctly most noticed in beginning
* What persuades people to stick around to produce something useful?
** "_People should feel that their connection to a project, and influence over it, is directly
proportional to their contributions._"

== Chapter 2: Getting started

* *Terminology clarification*:
** _User_: Uses project as part of personal / professional work
** _Developer_: Contributes bugfixes and enhancements back upstream to project
* Need to acquire:
** Users
** Developers
* Appearances matter
** Acknowledging importance of first impression
** Detecting investment of care
** Impression created carries over to rest of project by association
* *SCORING*: Obvious where a link goes before clicking on it
** Developer vs. user documentation
* Presence of certain stand offerings reassures users (to use project) and developers (to contribute)
** Send message: "_Your time will not be wasted if you get involved_"
* Common for developers to be users, but not always
** Especially for large projects created to meet enterprise-scale needs
** Developers may not be direct users but usually involved with an internal team that uses the software

=== Starting From What You Have

* Transform private vision to public one
** Organizing / documenting things everyone involved already knows
* Minimum activation energy to on-board contributors
* *SCORING*: Choose a good name
** A good name:
*** Gives an idea of what project does
*** Easy to remember (non-native speakers)
*** Not a duplicate / does not infringe trademark
*** Available as .com/.net/.org TLDs
*** Available on micro-blogging sites (e.g. Twitter)
* *SCORING*: Clearly state project is open source
** Make license choice obvious
** Make it obvious, and include it with source code
* *SCORING*: Offer features / requirements list
** Something to give someone asking for quick summary of software
* *SCORING*: Development status
** Reflect reality
* *SCORING*: Downloads / ease of building
** Many projects don't standardize install procedures until late
** "We'll sort it out when the code is closer to being ready"
** This takes code longer to get ready
** Discourages developers who may otherwise have contributed, if they could build / test it
** Project will never know they are losing developers
*** Who will ever know except the person themselves?
** Boring work with high payoff should _always_ be done early
* *SCORING*: Unique version number (https://semver.org/[semver.org])
* *SCORING*: Public and active bug tracker
** More bugs in database, the _better_ the project looks, because:
*** Absolute number of actual software defects present
*** Number of people using software
*** Convenience with which those people report new bugs
** Any software of sufficient size and complexity has arbitrary number of bugs to discover
*** How well does project record and prioritize them?
** Empty is scary
** New project has less, but key part is a _healthy rate_ of filings
** http://www.rants.org/2010/01/10/bugs-users-and-tech-debt/[Bugs are good news]
* *SCORING*: Communications channels present
** Way to reach the developers
** Like a chat room
* *SCORING*: Developer / contributing guidelines
** More social than technical
** Where to interact with developers
** Insturctions to report bugs and submit patches
** Indication of how development is done and how decisions are made
* *SCORING*: Documentation present
** Need something for people to read, if crude and incomplete
** Documentation is never really finished; sometimes why it is delayed
** Usefulness of documentation inverse for those who write it from those who read it
*** Cover the basics: Set up software, overview of how it works, guides for common tasks
** Limit scope of documentation in advance
*** Avoids it feeling too open-ended
** Recommended criteria:
*** Establish pre-required technical expertise
*** Walk through initial set up of software clearly and thoroughly (_most critical to avoid early abandonment of project_)
*** Tutorial-style example of common task
*** Label areas where documentation is known to be incomplete (_reassuring_)
**** Does not promise deadline, but also treated as open call for help
** Identify project shortcomings, it is not defeat
*** Give realistic vision for state of project
*** Better for someone to be psychologically prepared for reality than stumbling in dark
** FAQs are valuable investments if maintained
** *Visual assets*: Screenshots, video to introduce project
*** Demo sites also work
*** Cater to instant gratification (single screenshot / video sometimes more valuable than paragraphs of descriptive text)
*** Image-based evidence of functionality
*** Video tips: Under four minutes, clearly state length
* *SCORING*: Availability of documentation
** Available online and in packaged version of software
* *SCORING*: Developer documentation
** Different from guidelines; this is technical, not social
** How to get along with the code itself
** Force that drives people to learn codebase is it does something useful for them
*** If useful, they take the time to figure things out
*** If not, nothing will get or keep them
** *Prioritze users before developers*, if you must
*** User docs are effectively developer docs

=== Setting the Tone

* Written policies do not define project's culture so much as describe it
* People show up expecting and looking for social norms
** Behaviors to mark them as part of the group ("fitting in")
** Behaviors become self-perpetuating
* *SCORING*: Avoid private discussions
** Fear of settling difficult questions, so discussed privately with inner circle
** Disasvantages to public:
*** Delay in email conversation
*** Sufficient time for consensus
*** Newcomers who think they understand but actually don't (could be star contributors later, or stay forever na√Øve)
*** Concern over different subsets of problems
** Great temptation to make decisions behind closed doors: *don't do it*
** "Contributor repellant"
** No serious contributors sticks around in project where critical decisions made privately
** Benefits of public conversation:
*** Train and educate new developers
*** Train you in explaining technical issues to people less familiar with project
*** Available in public archives, enabling future discussions to retrace
*** Possibility of real contribution to conversation (varying likelihood, but still realistically plausible)
** *If there is no reason for discussion to be private, keep it public*
** Requires active action: nudge private conversations to public
* *SCORING*: Don't tolerate rudeness
** Zero-tolerance does not imply technical enforcement
*** Never letting bad behavior slide by unnoticed
*** _Example_: In ad hominem attack mixed with technical comment, address ad hominem attack as separate issue from technical content
*** Short distance from calling a proposal stupid from a person being stupid
** _Pg. 28_: Stilted responses that call out bad behavior but don't demand apology or acknowledgement from offending party
** Never make meta-discussion the main topic
*** Keep it as an aside
*** "We don't do things that way around here"
** Good behavior as "in-group" behaviors
* *SCORING*: Have a Code of Conduct (that is enforcable and enforced)
** Reminds participants that a respectful and welcoming environment is everyone's responsibility
* *SCORING*: Practicing code review
** Reviewing commits as they come in, looking for bugs, improvements, etc.
** _Purpose_:
*** Maintain software quality
*** Validates meaningfulness of contributions (i.e. the work done actually matters)
** People do their best work when they know others take time to evaluate it
** Reviews should be public
* "In the open" means these things are public from Day One:
** Code repository
** Bug tracker
** Design documents
** User documentation
** Wiki
** Developer discussion forums
** Code and documentation under open source license
* "In the open" does not have to mean:
** Allow strangers to check code into repository
** Allow anyone to file bug reports
** Reading and responding to every bug repot filed
** Responding to every question people ask in the forums
** Reviewing every patch or suggestion posted
* *You open source your code, not your time*


== Chapter 4: Social and Political Infrastructure

=== Forkability

* Consider the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor[bus factor]
* *Forkability*: Ability for anyone to take copy of source and use it to start a competing project
** Binds developers together
** Encourages desire to compromise
* Forks are why there is no "true" dictatorship
** Projects not organized as democracies are still practically democracies
** Replicability implies forkability
** Forkability implies consensus
* Some projects may defer to one leader, but it is a decision they willingly choose
* Forkability does not put upper limit on how much power is exerted in a project
** Every decision made should not come down last-resort question of fork possibility


== Chapter 5: Participating as a Business, Non-Profit, or Government Agency

=== Appear as Many, Not as One

* Developers should publicly appear as individual participants (instead of monolithic "corporation")
** Open source projects only equipped to deal with individuals
** Individual contributors have discussions, submit patches, acquire creditability, vote, etc. ‚Äì companies cannot
* Behaving in decentralized manner avoids stimulating opposition
** Encourage reviewing other's code often
** Discourage voting as a bloc (others may feel need for organized effort to keep them in check)

=== Be Open About Your Motivations

* Be open about organization goals without compromosing business secrets
