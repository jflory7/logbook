= Carl Fogel - Producing Open Source Software notes

== Chapter 1: Introduction

* What persuades people to stick around to produce something useful?
** "_People should feel that their connection to a project, and influence over it, is directly
proportional to their contributions._"

== Chapter 2: Getting started

* *Terminology clarification*:
** _User_: Uses project as part of personal / professional work
** _Developer_: Contributes bugfixes and enhancements back upstream to project
* Need to acquire:
** Users
** Developers
* Appearances matter
** Acknowledging importance of first impression
** Detecting investment of care
** Impression created carries over to rest of project by association
* *SCORING*: Obvious where a link goes before clicking on it
** Developer vs. user documentation
* Presence of certain stand offerings reassures users (to use project) and developers (to contribute)
** Send message: "_Your time will not be wasted if you get involved_"
* Common for developers to be users, but not always
** Especially for large projects created to meet enterprise-scale needs
** Developers may not be direct users but usually involved with an internal team that uses the software

=== Starting From What You Have

* Transform private vision to public one
** Organizing / documenting things everyone involved already knows
