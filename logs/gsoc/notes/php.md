PHP in Fedora Infrastructure
============================

This notepad has information about implementing a PHP / PHP-FPM role within Fedora's infrastructure, based on feedback given to me by Patrick and information I discover on my own. For now, PHP is "low-hanging" fruit in terms of what needs to happen with my proposal. Sticking with standard PHP and revisiting PHP-FPM later if there is time and ability to do so for now.

**Will revisit this notepad later.**
