## Ansible


## ANSWERED

The following questions have already been answered.

* How does Fedora Infrastructure handle creating databases with MySQL via Ansible? Tried searching through existing playbooks but could not seem to find an example.
 * All MySQL / MariaDB databases are created manually. There is no way to automate the creation of a database with Ansible in this situation. This should be referenced and documented in the SOP later.
