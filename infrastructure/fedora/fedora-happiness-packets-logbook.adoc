= Infrastructure logbook: Fedora Happiness Packets (FHP)

This page provides notes on the deployment of the https://pagure.io/fedora-commops/fedora-happiness-packets[Fedora Happiness Packets] project.
Eventually, these notes should be reflected in project documentation.


== Dependencies

"Dependencies" refer to RPM packages that must be installed for the application to work.
Usually these are required when running `pip install` in a later step.
Note that *Python 3 is required* to deploy the application.

* *Packages*:
** `epel-release`
** `openssl-devel`
** `python36`
** `python36-devel`
** `python36-pip`


== Existing staging deployment

These notes document how the FHP staging deployment is set up:

* Production app running in Python virtualenvs on staging server
* Uses Gunicorn web server to run application (manage with `systemctl {status,restart,start,stop} gunicorn`)
